			text: "Kevin did such an amazing job with my baby! My car was way overdue for detailing. After 6.5 years of having it, it looked dated and old. Kevin gave it much needed facelift and made it look brand new again.\nThe windows are beautifully clean, no smog or dirty film residue left on them as it sometimes happens when I have it just car washed. He also made sure to go over every surface on the inside and get into every crevice he could. My headlights look brand new.\nI am super impressed and he offers a very affordable price for his work. Thank you so much!!!! I will be coming back for sure. ðŸ™‚",

Having a 2 year old makes it a little bit harder keeping the inside clean with all the cereal, goldfish & all sorts of snacks in the floor board. He had the outside shining like new and the inside was spotless! He is your guy when it comes to detailing!!",
